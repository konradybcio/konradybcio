# Hello there! 👋🏻

I'm Konrad, a 19 y/o hobbyist Linux kernel / embedded developer from Poland 🇵🇱.

If you have a Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered device, I can probably make mainline Linux run on it! (or maybe I already did? 😉)

I'm a Reviewer for the linux-arm-msm project. I am also one of the folks that got Linux running on the 🍎 iDevices!

Check out my (infrequently updated) list of achievements over at [konradybcio.pl/mywork](https://konradybcio.pl/mywork)!

I push most of my Linux work to the repos at @SoMainline.

If you appreciate my work, you can support me over at Ko-fi:
