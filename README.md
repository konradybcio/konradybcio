# Hello there! 👋🏻

I'm Konrad, a 20 y/o Linux kernel / embedded developer from Poland 🇵🇱.

If you have a Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered device, I can probably make mainline Linux run on it! (or maybe I already did? 😉)

I'm a Co-maintainer for the linux-arm-msm project. I am also one of the folks that got Linux running on the 🍎 iDevices!

Check out my (very infrequently updated) list of achievements over at [konradybcio.pl/mywork](https://konradybcio.pl/mywork)!

I push most of my Linux work straight to [linux-arm-msm](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-msm/), my WIP patches often get pushed to [@SoMainline/linux](https://github.com/SoMainline/linux/commits/konrad/longbois-next).
