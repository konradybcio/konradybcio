Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I'm a hobbyist Linux kernel / embedded developer.

If you have a Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered device, I can probably make mainline Linux run on it! (or maybe I already did? ðŸ˜‰)

Check out my (probably outdated) list of achievements over at konradybcio.pl/mywork!

I'm a Reviewer for the linux-arm-msm project.

If you appreciate my work, you can support me over at ko-fi:
